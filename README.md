# ICONOIR Helper

Create customized CSS from iconoir icons.

I needed a customize CSS from iconoir cions with just a few icons for a small website, so I wrote this little tool one evening.

Just select the icons you want to use and copy the generated CSS for use in your project.

May it be useful for others.
